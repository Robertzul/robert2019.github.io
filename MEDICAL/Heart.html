        <h2> HEART FAILURE, HEART ATTACK AND CARDIAC ARREST</h2>
        <p> 
            <strong>Heart failure </strong> comes in many forms and has many causes
        </p>
        <p>
            Even though it may sound like it, congestive <strong>heart failure</strong> 
            does not necessarily mean that the heart has failed.<br />
            However, heart failure is a serious condition where the
            heart does not pump blood around the body efficiently.
        </p>
        <p> 
            We depend on the pumping action of the heart to deliver nutrient- and  
            oxygen-rich blood to every cell in the body.<br />
            When cells are not nourished adequately, it is not 
            possible for the body to function properly.<br />
            If the heart is weakened and cannot supply the cells with sufficient blood, 
            the patient becomes tired and breathless.<br />
            Everyday activities that were once taken for granted
            become challenging.
        </p>
        <p> 
            <strong>Heart failure</strong> is a serious condition, and there is usually no cure. 
            However , with the right treatment, the patient can still
            lead an enjoyable, meaningful, and productive life.
        </p>
        <h2>Heart failure, heart attack, and cardiac arrest </h2>
        <p>
            here we explain some important terms:<br />
            <strong>HEART ATTACK</strong> This is death of the heart 
            muscle dual to the blockage of a coronary artery.The heart 
            muscle dies because it is starved of oxygen (because blood
             is not getting to it).<br />
            <strong>HEART FAILURE</strong> This means the heart muscle
            cannot pump blood around the body properly. is not a heart attack.<br />
            <strong>CARDIAC ARREST</strong> This means the heart stops,
            blood circulation stops, and there is no pulse
        </p>
        <h2>Causes</h2>
        <p>
            <strong>Heart failure</strong> is caused by any conditions
            that damage the heart muscle. these include:<br />
            </p>

            <p>
            <strong>Coronary artery disease</strong> the coronary 
            arterie supply the heart muscle with blood. if these
            blocked or the flow is reduced, the heart does not receive 
            the blood supply it needs

        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Heart attack</strong> a sudden block of the coronary arteries;
            this causes scars in the heart's tissues and decreases 
            how effectively it can pump.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Cardiomyopathy</strong>damage to the heart muscle 
            other than by artery or blood flow problems; instance caused by drug side
            effects or infections.
        </p>
        <p>
<strong>Conditions that overwork the heart</strong> for instance valve
            disease hypertension (high blood pressure), diabetes, kidney diasease, or
            heart defects present from birth.
        </p>
        <h2>  THE RISK FACTORS FOR CONGESTIVE  HEART FAILURE  </h2>
        <p>
            <strong>Diabetes</strong> especially diabetes type 2
            <br /><strong>Obesity</strong> people who are both obese and 
            have diabetes type 2 have an increased risk.
            <br /><strong>Smoking</strong> people who smoke reqularly
            run a significantly higher risk of developing heart failure.
            <br /> <strong>Anemia</strong> a deficienecy of red blood cells.
            <br /><strong>Hyperthyroidism</strong> overactive thyroid gland.
            <br /><strong>Hypothyroidism</strong> underactive thyroid gland.
            <br /><strong>Myocarditis</strong> inflammation of the heart muscle
            usually caused by avirus leading to left-side heart failure.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Heart arrhythmias</strong> abnormal heart rhythms,
            they may cause the heart to beat too fast,
            creating more work for the heart.Eventually the heart may weaken,
            leading to to heart failure. <br /> If heartbeat is too slow not enough blood
            may out from the heart to the body, leading to heart failure.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Atrial fibrillation</strong> an irregular, often
            rapid heart beart; patients with atrial fibrillation have a higher risk
            of hospitalization due to heart fail a studdy found.
            <br /><strong>Emphysema</strong> a chronic disease that 
            make it hard for the patient to breathe.
            <br /><strong>Lupus</strong> the patient's immune system attacks healthy cells
            and tissues.<br />
            <strong>Hemochromatosis</strong> a condition where iron accumulates in the 
            tissues.
        </p>
        <<h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
        <p>
            Fatigue and dizziness are possible symptoms of heart failure.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Congested lungs</strong> fluid builds up in the lungs
            and causes shortness of breath even when resting and
            particularly when lying down.<br />
            It can also cause a hacking, dry cough.

        </p>
        <p>
           <strong >Fluid retention</strong> because less blood is being
            pumped to the kidneys, it can cause water retention. This 
            can cause swollen ankles, legs, and abdomen. It can also
            cause weight gain and increased urination.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Fatigue and dizziness</strong> because less blood is 
            reaching the organs of the body, it can cause feelings of weakness.
            Because less blood is reaching the brain is can also cause
            dizziness and confusion.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Irregular and rapid heartbeats</strong> to try and 
            counteract the lack of blood being pumped with each contraction of the 
            heart, the heart might pump more quickly.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Heart failure</strong> shares symptoms with other 
            conditions, and if anyone has the symptoms, it does not mean 
            they have heart failure.
            <br /> However, anyone who experiences more than one of the 
            symptoms should tell their doctor and ask for an evaluation of their heart.
        </p>
        <h2>TYPES</h2>
        <p>
            There are many different types of heart failure:
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Left-sided heart failure</strong>
            <br />left-sided heart failure is the most common form of
            congestive heart failure. The left side of the heart is 
            responsible for pumping blood to rest of the body.<br />
            Blood backs up into the lungs as it is not effectively 
            pumped away from the heart. This can cause shortness of breath
            and fluid buildup.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Right-sided heart failure</strong>
            <br />The right side of the heart pumps blood to the lungs
            where it collects oxygen.<br /> Right-side failure is, most 
            often, caused by fluid-up in the lungs due to left-side failure. Sometimes it
            can occur due to ther condition,including lung disease
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Diastolic heart failure</strong>
            <br />This occurs when the heart muscle is stiffer than normal.<br />
            Because the heart is stiff, it does not fill up with blood 
            properly; this is known as diastolic dysfunction.<br />
            Because the heart does not fill up with blood, it cannot pass as much blood 
            around the body as is necessary. This can occur on either side of the heart.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Systolic heart failure</strong>
            <br />Systolic dysfunction describes the heart's inability
             to pump efficiently after filling with blood. it often
            occurs if the heart is weak or enlarged.This can occur on 
            either side of the heart.
        </p>
        <h2>DIAGNOSIS</h2>
        <p>
            Most people will initially see their doctor if they have
            symptoms. The doctor will discuss the symptoms with the patient. if the doctor 
            suspects heart failure, he will recommend further tests, these may include:

        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Blood and tests</strong> these will check the patient's blood
             count and liver, throid, and kindney function. The doctor may also want to
            check the blood for specific chemical markers heart failure.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Chest X-ray</strong> an X-ray will show whether the haert is enlarged.
        It will also show whether there is fluid in the lungs.
            </p> 
        <p>
            <strong>An ECG (electrocardiogram)</strong> this device records
            the electrical activity and rhythms of the patient's heart.<br />
            The test may also reveal any damage to the heart from a 
            heart attack.
            
        </p>
        <hr />
        <h2>PREVENTION AND MANAGEMENT</h2>
        <p>
            Giving up smoking is a way to reduce the likelihood of heart failure, or slow its
            progression.
        </p>
        <p>
            There are many lifestyle changes that reduce the chances of developing heart
            failure, or at lest slow down its progression.These include:
        </p>
        <p>
            Give up smoking.
            <br />1.  Eat sensibly, this includes plenty of fruit and vegetable, good quality fats, unrefined 
             carbohydrates, whole grains, and the right amount of daily calories.
            <br /> 2. Exercise reqularly and stay physically active 
            (check with your doctor).
            <br />3.  Keep blood pressure low.
            <br />4. Maintain a healthy body weight.
            <br />5. Quit aclcohol, or at least consume alcohol with the
            national recommended limits.
            <br />6.  Get at least 7 hours good quality sleep each night.
            <br />7.  Mental stress may be bad for the heart over the long-term.
            Try to find ways of reducing exposure to mental stress.
            <br />8.  Individuals who already have heart failure should be 
            up-to-date with their vaccinations, and have a yearly flu shot.
        </p>
        <h2> TREATMENTS</h2>
        <p>
            Damage to the heart's pumping action caused by heart failure
            cannot be repaired. Nevertheless, current  treatments can 
            significantly imrove the quality of life of the patient by keeping the
            condition under control and helping relieve many of the 
            symptoms.
        </p>
        <p>
            Treatment also focuses on treating any conditions that may be
            causing the heart failure, which in turn lessens the burden
            on the heart. A doctor or cardiologist will discuss treatment
            options with the patient and suggest the best choices, depending 
            on individual circumstances.
