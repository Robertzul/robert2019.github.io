        <hr />
        <h2>STROKE</h2>
      <p>  <strong> STROKES</strong> are brain attacks. They occur
        when the blood supply to the brain becomes blocked.<br />
        A <strong>STROKE</strong> is a medical emergency that needs immediate
        medical attention.</p>
        <p>
            Brain cells need a constant supply of oxygen and nutrients.
            They are delivered by a network of blood vessels that reach
            every part of the brain. When something cut off that supply, brain cells
            downstream begin to die.<br /> The injury that follows is called a 
            <strong>STROKE.</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          Most strokes strike when a blood clot becomes lodged in one of the brain's
            arteries, blocking blood flow.<br />
            In some cases, the clot forms inside the artery, usually becuse a 
            cholesterol-filled plaque inside the artery breaks open. This 
            is called a <strong>thrombotic stroke</strong>.<br />

        </p>
        <p>
            In other cases, a blood clot or a solid mass of debris that
            originates elsewhere trvels to the brain, where it blocks a
            brain artery. This called an <strong>embolic stroke.</strong>
        </p>
       <p>
           A third type of stroke, <strong>hemorrhagic stroke,</strong> 
           occurs when a blood vessel in the brain bursts.
       </p>
        <p>
            Your doctor can evaluate your risk for stroke and help you 
            control your risk factors. Some before a stroke occurs
        </p>
        <p>
            These are called transient <strong>ischemic attack</strong> 
           (also called <strong>TIA</strong> OR "MINI-STROKE") and are
            short, brief episodes of the stroke symptoms listed above.
            Some people have no symptoms are so mild they are not noticeable.<br />
            Regular check-ups are inportant in catching problems
            before they become serious. Report any symptoms or risk factors to your 
            doctor.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>ischemic stroke</strong> is similar to a <strong>heart attack</strong>
            except it occurs in the blood vessels of the brain.<br />
            Clots can form in the brain's blood vessels, in blood
            vessels leading to the brain, or even in blood vessels 
            elsewhere in the body and then travel to the brain.
            These clots block blood flow to the brain's cells.<br />
            <strong>Ischemic stroke</strong> can also occur when too much plaque
            (fatty deposits and cholesterol) clogs the brain's blood vessels.<br />
            About 80% of all stroke are <strong>ischemic</strong>.

             
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Hemorrhagic (heh-more-raj-ik) strokes</strong> occur 
            when a blood vessel in the brain breaks or ruptures. The 
            result is blood seeping into the brain tissue, causing damage
            to brain cells.<br />
            The most common causes of hemorrhagic stroke are
            <strong>high blood pressure</strong> and brain aneurysms.
            An <strong>aneurysm</strong> is a weakness or thinness in the 
            blood vessel wall.

        </p>
        <h2>Symptoms of Stroke</h2>
        <p><strong>The most common symptoms of a stroke are:</strong>
            <br />
            <br />1. Weakness or numbness of the face, arm, or leg one side
            of the body
            <br />2. Loss of vision or dimming (like a curtain falling) in
            one or both eyes
           <br />3. Loss of speech, difficulty talking, or understanding
            what others are saying
            <br />4. Sdden, severe headache with no known cause
            <br />5. Loss of balance or unstable walking, usually
            combined with another symptom
            </p>
        <p>
            <br />6. <strong>paralsis or loss of muscle movement</strong> You
            may become paralzed on one side of your body, or lose control of certain
            muscles, such as those one side of your face one arm.
            Physical therapy may help you return to activities affected by paralysis
            such as walking, eating and dressing.
        </p>
        <p>
            7.<strong> Difficulty talking or swallowing</strong> A stroke
            might affect control of the muscles in your mouth and throat, making it difficult
            for you to talk clearly (dysarthria), swallow (dysphagia)
            or eat. You also may have difficult with language (aphasia), 
            includind speaking or understanding speech, reading, or writing.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Memory loss or thinking difficulties</strong> Many 
            people who have had strokes experience some memory loss.
            Others may have difficulty thinking, making judgments, 
            reasoning and understanding concepts.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Emotional problems</strong> people who have had strokes may have
            more difficulty controlling their emotions, or they may 
            develop depression.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Changes in behavior and self-care ability</strong>  People who
             have had strokes may become more withdrawn and less social
             or more impulsive. They may need help with grooming and daily
            chores.          
        </p>
        <h2>PREVENTION</h2>
        <p>
            Many stroke prevention strategies are the same as strategies to prevent heart 
            disease. In general, healthy lifesyle recommendations include:
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Controlling high blood pressure (hypertension)</strong>. This is one
            of the most important things you can do to reduce your stroke
            risk. If you've had a stroke, lowering your blood pressure
            can help prevent a subsequent TIA or stroke. 
        </p
            ><p>
                Exercising,managing stress, maintaining a healthy weight
                and limiting the amount of sodium and alcohol you eat
                and drink can all help to keep high blood pressure in check.<br />
                In addition to recommending lifestyle changes, your doctor may
                prescribe medications to treat high blood pressure.
            </p>

        <p>
            <strong>Lowering the amount of cholesterol and saturated fat in your diet</strong>. Eating
            less cholesterol and fat, especially saturated fat and trans fats, may
            reduce the plaque in your arteries. If you can't control your 
            cholesterol through dietary changes alone, your doctor may
             prescribe a cholesterol-lowering medication.

        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Quiting tobacco use</strong>. Smoking raises the risk
            of stroke for smokers and nonsmokers exposed to secondhand
            smoke. Quitting tobacco use reduces your risk of stroke.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Controlling diabetes</strong>. You can manage diabetes
            with diet, exercise, weight control and medication.
        </p>
        <p>
           <strong>Maintaining a healthy weight</strong>. Being 
            overweight contributes to other stroke risk factors, such
            as high blood pressure, cardiovascular disease and diabetes.
            Losing as little as 10 pounds may lower your blood 
            pressure and improve your cholesterol levels.
        </p>               
        <p>
            <strong>Eating a diet rich in fruits and vegetables</strong>
            A diet containing five or more daily servings of fruits or 
            vegetables may reduce your  risk of stroke. Following the 
           mediterranean diet, which emphasizes olive oil, fruit, nuts, vegetables and 
            whole grains, may be helpful.
        </p>
        <p>
         <strong>Exercising regularly</strong>. Aerobic or "cardio"
            exercise reduces your risk of stroke in many ways.<br />
            Exercise can lower your blood pressure, increase your level of
            high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and improve the overall
            health of your blood vessels and heart. It also helps you lose
            weight, control diabetes and reduce stress.Gradually work up to 30 
            minutes of activity - such as walking, jogging, swimming or
            bicycling - on most, if not all, days of the week.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Drinking alcohol in moderation, if at all</strong>. Alcohol can be both a risk factor. 
            However drinking small to moderate amounts of alcohol, such
            as one drink a day, may help prevent ischemic stroke and decrease your blood's
            clotting tendency. Alcohol may also interact with other drugs
            you're taking. Talk to your doctor about what's appropriate for you
        </p>
        <hr />
        <h2>MEDICATIONS</h2>
        <p>
            <strong>Anti-platelet drugs</strong>. platelets are cells in 
            your blood that form clots. Anti-platelet drugs make 
            these cells less sticky and less likely to clot.<br />
            The most commonly used anti-platelet medication is
            aspirin. Your doctor can help you determine the right 
            right does of aspirin for you.<br />
            Your doctor might also consider prescribing  Aggrenox, a 
            combination of low-dose aspirin and the anti-platelet
             drug dipyridamole to reduce the risk of blood clotting.If aspirin doesn't 
            prevent your TIA or stroke, or if you can't take aspirin, your 
            doctor may instead prescribe an anti-plateled drug such as clopidogrel
        </p>
        <p>
           <strong>Anticoagulants</strong>. These drugs, which include heparin and
             warfain (Coumadin jantoven), reduce blood clotting. Heparin
            is fast acting acting and may be used over a short period of 
            time in the hospital. Slower acting warfarin may be used over a longer term.<br />

            Warfarin is a powerful blood-thinning drug, so you'll need to
            take it exactly as directred and watch for side effects. Your 
            doctor may prescribe these drugs if you have certain blood-clotting disorders,
            certain arterial abnormalities, an abnormal heart rhythm or
            other newer blood thinners may be used if your TIA or stroke was caused by an 
            abnormal heart rhythm.
