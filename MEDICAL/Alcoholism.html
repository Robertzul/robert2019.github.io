         <h2>ALCOHOL  </h2>
      
          <p><strong>Health Risks of Chronic Heavy Drinking</strong><br />

<br />If you have a little too much <strong>alcohol </strong> once in a while, it 
            probably won't do lasting damage if you're otherwise healthy.
             But it's a different story if you regularly drink heavily.
        </p>
        <p>
            For most men, that's defined as more 4 drinks a day, or 14 or 15 in 
            a week. For women, heavy  drinking is more 3 drinks in a day,
            or 7 or 8 per week.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Too much alcohol can harm you physically and mentally in lots of ways</strong>
        </p>
      <p>
          <strong>LIVER DAMAGE </strong><br />
          Alcohol is a toxin, and it's your liver's job to flush it out of 
          your body. But your liver may not be able to keep up if you drink 
          too much too fast. Alcohol can<strong> kill liver cells</strong>,
           lead to scarring called <strong>cirrhosis.</strong> Long-term 
          heavy use of alcohol also may give you alcoholic 
          <strong>fatty liver disease, </strong> a sign  that your liver 
          doesn't work as well as it should.
      </p>
        <p><strong>HEART DISEASE </strong><br />
            You may know about the dangers of blood clots and high levels 
            of fats and cholesterol in your body. Alcohol makes both 
            things more likely. Studies of heavy drinker also  show that 
            they are more likely to have trouble pumping blood to 
            their heart and may have a higher chance of dying from 
            heart disease.<br />
            Excessive drinking  can lead to high blood pressure and increases
            your risk of an enlarged heart, heart  failure or stroke. Even 
            a single binge can causes a serious heart arrhythmia called 
            <strong>atrial fibrillation.</strong>

        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>BRAIN AND NERVOUS SYSTEM PROBLEMS </strong><br />
            Alcohol affect the <strong>brain</strong>'s communication 
            pathways. This makes it harder for you to think and speak 
            clearly, remember things, make decisions, and move your body.
            Heavy drinking also can cause <strong>mental health </strong>  
             issues like <strong>depression </strong> and <strong>dementia.</strong>
             You may get painful <strong>nerve damage</strong>
            that may linger long after you sober up
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>  Anemia</strong> <br />
            This is when your body doesn't make enough healthy <strong> red blood cells  </strong> to
             move oxygen around. That may give you ulcers, inflammtion,
             and other problems. Too much booze may also make you more
            likely to skip meals,which can short-change your body of iron.        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>DIABETES COMPLICATIONS</strong><br />
            Alcohol interferes with the release of glucose from your liver 
            and can increase the risk of low blood sugar (hypoglycemia).
             This is dangerous if you have  diabetes and are already taking 
            insulin to lower you blood sugar level
        </p>
        <p>

            <strong>CANCER</strong><br />
            There is a clear link between heavy alcohol use many types of 
            cancers. Alcohol can damage the cells in your mouth, throat, 
            voice box, and esophagus. It can lead to cancers in your liver, 
             breast, and intestines. Alcohol can help cancer causing 
            chemicals in tobacco and other sources enter your cells more
            easily.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Weakened immune system.</strong> <br />
            Excessive alcohol  use can make it harder
            for your body to resist disease, increase  your risk  of various 
            illnesses, especially pneumonia.
        </p>

        <p><strong>SEIZURES </strong><br />
            Long-tem alcohol abuse may raise your chances for epilepsy. 
            And alcohol withdrawal after heavy drinking can causes <strong>sizures</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>SEXUALLY FUNCTION AND MENSTRUATION ISSUES  </strong><br />
            Excessive drinking can cause erectile dysfunction in men. In
             women, it can interupt menstruation.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>EYE PROBLEMS </strong><br />
            Over time, heavy drinking can cause involuntary rapid eye
            movement (nystagmus) as well as weakness and paralysis of 
            your eyes 
        </p>
        <p><strong>GOUT</strong><br />
This form of arthritis results from painful buildup of uric acid in the
            joints. You can get gout from eating too much food high in 
            chemicals called purines, which include red meat, shellfish.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>INFECTIONS</strong><br />
            Heary drinking can hamper your immune cells from  fighting 
            off viruses and bacteria. It also can harm your liver, 
            which plays an important role in your immune system by 
            making antibacterial proteins.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>  DIGESTIVE PROBLEMS</strong> <br />
             Booze is caustic. It can inflame the stomach lining, 
            causing   heartburn and nausea. Over time, this can give you 
            ulcers and chronic inflammation in your stomach, 
             esophagus, and gut. It can also make it harder for your 
            intestines to digest important nutrients like B12 and thiamine.
             Alcohol can also cause a buildup of digestive enzymes in 
            the pancreas, leading to a condition called pancreatitis, or 
            an inflamed  pancreas. This can affect how much insulin 
            you make, putting you at higher risk for diabetes.

        <h2>ALCOHOL USE DISORDER </h2>
        <p>
<strong>Alcohol use disorder </strong> (which includes a level that's 
            sometimes called <strong>alcoholism </strong> is a pattern 
            of alcohol use the that involves problems controlling 
             your drinking, being preoccupied with alcohol, continuing 
            to use alcohol even when it causes problems, having to drink more to get the same
             effect, or having withdrawal symptoms when you rapidly
             decrease or stop drinking.
            
             
        </p>
        <p>
            Unhealthy alcohol use includes any alcohol use that puts your 
            health or safety at risk or causes other alcohol-related problems. 
            It also includes binge drinking - a pattern of drinking where a
            male consumes five or more drinks within two hours or a female 
            downs at least four drinks  within two hours. Binge drinking causes 
             significant health and safety risks.
            </p>
        <p>
            If your pattern of drinking resuls in repeated significant 
            distress  and problems functioning in your daily life, you 
            likely have alcohol use disorder. It can range from mild to 
             severe. However, even a mild disorder can escalate and lead 
            to serious problems, so early treatment is important.
        </p>
        <h2>SYMPTOMS </h2>
        <p>
            Alcohol use disorder can be mild, moderate or severe, based 
            on the number of symptoms you experience. Signs and symptoms may 
            include:
        </p>
        <p>
            Being unable to limit the amount of alcohol you drink 
            
            
             
        </p>
        <p>
            Wanting to cut down on how much you drink or making 
            unsuccessful attempts to do so
        </p>
        <p>
            Spending a lot of time drinking, getting alcohol or recovering 
            from alcohol use
        </p>
        <p>
            Feeling a strong craving or urge to drink alcohol 
        </p>
        <p>
            Failing to fulfill major obligations at work, school or home due to repeated 
            alcohol  use
        </p>
        <p>
            Continuing to drink alcohol even though you know it's causing 
            physical, social or interpersonal problems 
        </p>
        <p>
            Giving up or reducing social and work activities and hobbies 
        </p>
        <p>
            Using alcohol in situations where it's not safe, such 
            when drinking or swimming 
        </p>
        <p>
            Developing a tolerance to alcohol so you need more to feel 
            its effect or you have a reduced effect from the same amount 
        </p>
        <hr />
        <h2>CAUSES  </h2>
        <p>
            Genetic, psychological, social and environmental factors can 
            impact how drinking alcohol affects your body and behavior. 
            Theories suggest that for certain people drinking has a 
            drinking has a different and stronger impact that can lead to 
            alcohol use disorder
        </p>
        <p>
            Over time, drinking too much alcohol may change the normal 
            function of the areas of your brain associated with the 
            experience of pleasure, judgment and the ability to exercise 
            control over your behavior. This may result in craving alcohol to try 
            to restore good feelings or reduce  negative ones.
        </p>
        <h2>RISK FACTORS </h2>
        <p>
            Alcohol use may begin in the teens, but alcohol use disorder 
            occurs more frequently in the 20s and 30s, though it can 
            start at any age.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Steady drinking over time.</strong> Drinking too much 
            on a reqular basis for an extended period or binge drinking 
            on a reqular basis can lead to alcohol-related problems or
             alcohol use disorder.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Starting at an early age. </strong> People who begin 
            drinking - especially binge drinking - at an early age are 
            at a higher risk of alcohol use disorder.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Family history.</strong> The risk of alcohol use 
            disorder is higher for people who have a parent or other close
             relative who has problems with alcohol. This may be 
            influenced  by genetic factors.
        </p>
        <h2>COMPLICATIONSIN </h2>
        <P>
            Alcohol depress your central nervous system. In some people, 
             the initial reaction may  be stimulation. But as you 
            continue to drink, you become sedated.
        </P>
        <p>
            Too much aclcohol affect your speech, muscle  coordination 
            and vital centers of your  brain. A heavy drinking binge 
            may even cause a life-thereatening coma or death. This is of particular 
            concern when you're taking certain medications that also 
            depress the brain's fuction.
        </p>
        <h2>Impact on your safety </h2>
        <p>Exessive drinking can reduce your judgment skills 
            and lower inhibitions, leading  to poor choices and dangerous 
            situations or behaviors include <br />
            Motor vehicle accidents and other types of accidental injury, 
            such as drowning 

        </p>
        <h2>PREVENTION </h2>
        <p>
            Early intervention can prevent  alcohol-related problems in 
            teens. If  you have a teenager, be alert  to signs and symptoms 
            that may indicate a problem with alcohol:

        </p>

            1. Loss of interest in activities and hobbies and in personal
            appearance
        </p>
        <p>
            2. Red eyes, slurred speech, problems with  coordination and 
            memory lapses
        </p>
        <p>3. Difficulties or changes in relationships with friends, such  as 
            joining a new crowd<br />
            <br />
            4. Declining grades and problems  in school <br />
            <br />
            Frequent mood changes and defensive behavior

            </strong>
            1. Set a good example with your own alcohol use.n<br />
            <br />
            2. Talk openly with your child, spend quality time together 
            and become actively involved in your child's life.<br />
            <br />
            3. Let your child know what behavior you expect - and 
            what the consequences will be if he or she doesn't follow 
            the rules.
