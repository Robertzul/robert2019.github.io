         <h2>ANEMIA </h2>
        <p><strong>Anemia </strong> is a condition that develop when your 
            blood lacks enough healthy <strong>red blood cells</strong> or
             <strong>hemoglobin. </strong><br />
             Hemoglobin is a main part of <strong>red blood cells</strong>
             and <strong>binds oxygen.</strong> If you have too few or 
            abnormal red blood cells, or your hemoglobin is abnormal or 
            low, the cells in your body will not get enough oxygen.
            Symptoms of anemia  -- like  fatigue -- occur because 
            organs aren't getting what they need to function property.

        </p>
        <p>
            Your body makes  three  types of blood cells -  white blood cells to
             fight infection, platelets to help your blood clot and 
            red blood  cells to carry oxygen throughout your body.
        </p>
        <p>
Red blood cells contain<strong> hemoglobin</strong> - an iron - rich protein that gives 
            blood its red color.<strong> Hemoglobin</strong> enables red blood cells 
            to carry oxygen from your lungs to all parts of your body 
            and to carry carbon dioxide from other parts of the body 
            to your lungs so that it can be exhaled.
        </p>
     <p>   Most blood cells, including red blood cells, are produced 
        regularly  in your <strong>bone marrow</strong> - a spongy material
         found within the cavities of many of your large bones.
        To produce hemoglobin and red blood cells, your body needs iron,
         vitamin B-12, folate and other nutrients from the foods 
        you eat.</p>

        <p><strong>IMPORTANT FACTORS TO REMEMBER ARE:</strong><br />
            Certain forms anemia are hereditary and infants may be affected 
            from the time of birth.
            
        </p>
      <p>
Women in the chidbearing years are particularly susceptible to iron-deficiency
           anemia  because of the blood loss from  <strong>menstruating </strong>
           and the increased blood supply demands during <strong>pregnancy.</strong>
      </p>
        <p>
Older adults also  may have a greater risk of developing anemia because of 
            poor diet and other medical conditions.
        </p>
        <p>
            There are many types  of anemia. All are very different in their 
            causes and treatments. Iron-deficiency amemia, the most common type, 
            is very treatable with diet changes  and  iron supplements.
             Some forms of anemia -- like the mild anemia that develops 
            during pregnancy -- are even considered normal. However, some 
            types of anemia may prevent lifelong health problems. 
        </p>
        <hr />
        <h2>WHAT CAUSES ANEMIA?</h2>
        <p>
            There are more than 400 types of anemia, which  are divided 
            into  three groups:<br />
            <br />
            <strong>1. Anemia caused by blood loss</strong><br />
            <strong>2. Anemia caused by decreased or faulty  red blood cell
                production
            </strong><br />
            <strong>3. Anemia caused  by destruction of red blood cells</strong>
            
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Anemia Caused by Blood Loss </strong><br />
            Red blood  cells can be lost through bleeding, which  often can 
            occur slowly over a long period of time, and can go undecided.
             This kind of chronic bleeding commonly results from the following:

        </p>
        <p>
            Gastrointestinal conditions such as ulcers, hemorrhoids, gastritis 
            (inflammation of the stomach) and cancer <br />
            <br />
            Menstruation, especially if menstrual bleeding is excessive

        </p>
        <p>
<strong>Anemia Caused by Decreased or Faulty Red Blood Cell Production </strong><br />
            With this type  of anemia, the body cells may not function correctly.
            In either case, anemia can result. Red blood cells may be fault 
            or decreased due to abnormal red blood cells or a lack of minerals 
            and vitamins needed form  red blood cells to work property. Conditions 
            associated with these  causes of anemia  <strong>include the following:</strong> 
            

        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Sickle cell anemia  </strong><br />
            <strong>Iron-deficiency anemia </strong><br />
            <strong>Vitamin deficiency </strong><br />
            <strong>Bone marrow and stem cell problems  </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>SICKLE CELL ANEMIA. </strong><br />
            This inherited disorder and sometimes serious condition is
            an inherited hemolytic anemia. It caused by a defective form 
            of hemoglobin that forces red blood cells to assume an abnormal 
            crescent  (sickle) shaped because of a genetic defect. These irregular blood  cells die prematurely, 
            resulting in a chronic shortage of red blood cells.<br />
            They  break down rapidly, so oxygen does not get to the body's 
            organs, causing anemia. The crescent-shaped red blood cells can 
            also get stuck in tiny blood vessels causing pain.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>IRON DEFICIENCY ANEMIA. </strong><br />
            This  is the most  common type of anemia worldwide. Iron deficiency anemia is 
            caused by a shortage of iron in your body. Your bone marrow 
             in the center of the bone needs
             iron to make hemoglobin.<br />
            Hemoglobin, the pat of the red blood cell that transports 
            oxygen  to the body's organs. Without adequate iron, your body can't
             produce enough hemoglobin for red blood cells.<br />
            The result is iron-deficiency anemia.This type of anemia can caused by:<br />
            An iron-poor diet, especially in infants, children, teens, vegans,
             and vegetarians.<br />
            Menstruation, Frequent  blood donation, Certain drugs, foods,
             caffeinated drinks.
            Digestive conditions such  as crohn's disease or surgical 
            romoval of part the stomach or small intestine.<br />
            Without iron supplementation, this type of anemia occurs in many 
            pregnant women. It is also caused by blood loss, such as from 
            heavy menstrual bleeding, an ulcer, cancer and regular use of 
            some over-the-counter pain relievers,especially aspirin.
                                                                                

        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>VITAMIN DEFICIENCY ANEMIA. </strong><br />
            In addition to iron, your body needs folate and vitamin B-12 to 
            produce enough healthy red blood cells. A diet lacking in 
            these and other key nutrients can cause decreased red blood 
            cell production.<br />
            Additionally, some people may consume enough B-12, but their bodies 
            aren't able to process  the vitamin. This can lead to vitamin
            deficiency anemia, also know as pernicious anemia.<br />
            Condition leading to anemia caused by vitamin dificiency include:<br />
            <strong>Megaloblastic anemia:</strong> Vitamin B12 or folate or 
            both are defficient<br />
            <strong>Pernicious anemia:</strong> Poor vitamin B12 absorption <br />
           <strong> Dietary deficiency: </strong> Eating little or no meat
             may cause a lack of vitamin B12, while overcooking or eating 
            toofew vegetables may cause a folate deficiency .<br />
            <strong>Other causes of vitamin deficiency:</strong> pregnancy,
            certain medications, alcohol abuse, intestinal disease 
            such as tropical sprue and celiac  disease.<br />

            During early pregnancy, suffering <strong>folic acid </strong> 
            can help prevent the <strong>fetus</strong> from developing 
            neural tube defects such as <strong>spina bifida</strong> 

        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>BONE MARROW  AND STEM CELL PROBLEMS </strong><br />
            Prevent the body from producing enough red blood cells. Some of
             the <strong>stem cells </strong> found in bone marrow develop 
            into red blood cells. If <strong>stem cells </strong> are too few,
             defensive, or replaced by other cells such as metastatic cancer cells.<br /> 
            <strong>ANEMIA ASSOCIATED WITH BONE MARROW DISEASE </strong><br />
            A variety of disease, such as <strong>leukemia </strong>and<strong>myelofibrosis</strong>, can cause 
            anemia by affecting blood production in your bone marrow.
            The effects of these type of cancer and cancer-like disorders 
            vary from mild to life-threatening.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>APLASTIC  ANEMIA.</strong><br />
            This rare life-thereatening anemia occurs when your body doesn't 
            produce enough red blood cells. Causes of aplastic anemia include 
            infections, certain medicines, autoimmune disease and exposure to 
            toxic chemicals.
        </p>
        <p>
<strong>ANEMIA OF CHRONIC DISEASE </strong> Certain disease - such as Cancer,
             HIV/AIDS, Rheumatoid arthritis, Kidney disease, Crohn's disease 
            and other chronic  Inflammation diseases - can interfere with 
            the production of red blood cells.
            </p>
        <p>
           <strong>Hemolytic anemias.</strong><br />
            This group of anemias develops when red blood cells are develops
            when red blood cells are detroyed faster than bone marrow can 
            replace them. Certain blood diseases increase red blood cell destruction. 
            You  can inherit a hemolytic anemia, or you can develop  it later 
            in life.
            

        </p>
        <h2> SYMPTOMS OF ANEMIA </h2>
        <img src="AA.jpg"width="500" />
        <h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
        <p>
            Anemia signs and symptoms vary depending on the cause of your anemia.
            They may include:<br />
            <strong>Fatigue, Weakness, Pale or yellowish skin, Irregular heartbeat,
                 Shortness of breath, Dizziness or lightheadedness, 
                Chest pain, Headache, Cold hands and Feet
            </strong>
        </p>
        <h2>PREVENTION </h2>
       <p><strong>Eat a vitamin</strong>
           <br />
           Many types of anemia can't be prevented. But iron deficiency 
           anemias and can be avoided by having a diet that includes a 
           variety of vitamins and nutrients, including:
            
       </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Iron.</strong> Iron-rich foods include beef and other meats,
             beans, lentils, iron-fortified cereals, dark green leafy
              vegetables, and dried fruit.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Folate.</strong> This nutrient, and its synthetic  form
             folic acid, can be found in fruits and fruit juices, dark green, 
            leafy vegetables, green peas, Kidney beans, peanuts, and enriched  grain products, such 
            as bread, cereal pasta and rice.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Vitamin B-12.</strong> foods rich in vitamin B-12 include 
            meat, dairy products, and fortified cereal and soy products 
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Vitamin C.</strong> Food rich in vitamin c include 
            citrus fruits and juices, peppers, broccoli, tomatoes, melons 
            strawberry. This items help increase iron absorption.
