        <h2>what is a file </h2>
                 <p>
                     A <strong> file </strong> is a named collection of data. Furthermore, files tend to be too large to be held in the main storage and are therefore held on the backing storage devices such as magnetic disks. When data in a file is required for processing, the file is read into the main storage in manageable amounts. In addition, programs held on backing storage, and ready for use, may as well be regarded as “files” too. This said, you should note that we are primarily concerned with files stored for data processing. These files stored for data processing are called “data files”. This is done to distinguish them from files containing programs.

                     
                     
                 </p>
                 <br />
                 <h2>the purpose of files</h2>
                 <p>
                     A file holds data that is required for providing information. Some files are processed at regular intervals to provide this information, for example a payroll file. Others on the other hand hold data that is required at regular intervals, for example a file containing prices of items. Note the words “processed” and “required”, files such as payroll files are “processed” at regular intervals while files such as those containing prices of items are “required” at regular intervals.


                 </p>
                 <br />
                 <hr />
                 <h2>the two common ways of viewing files.</h2>
                 <p> A:<strong> logical files; </strong> A logical file is a file viewed in terms of what data items its records contain and what processing operations may be performed on the file. The user of the file will normally adopt such a view. Note the emphasis of “what”.
<br />B:  <strong> physical files; </strong> A physical file is a file viewed in terms of how the data is stored on a storage device such as a magnetic disk and how the processing operations are made possible. Note the emphasis on “how”.

</p>
                 <hr />
                 <h2>the structure of a file.</h2>
                 <p>
                     A file consists of a number of records. Each record is made up of a number of fields and each field is made up of a number of characters. This said you should note that the three elements of a computer file are:
<br />1: characters; a character is the smallest element in a file, and can be alphabetical, numeric or special.
<br />2: fields; a field is an item of data in a record. It is made up of a number of characters, for example, a name, a date, or an amount.
<br />3: records; records compromise of a series of related data items, and the successive data items in them may differ in type. Furthermore, a record is made up of a number of related fields. For example, customer records , or an employee payroll record.

<br />Note that within the file, the records, or fields within the records, may be of fixed or variable length.

<br />A: fixed length records; Fixed length records will all contain the same number of characters, and each record will have fields of fixed lengths too. For example, account numbers are fixed length records.

<br />B: variable length records; In a file with variable length records, each record may contain a different number of fields, and may have a different number of characters. An example would be customer addresses.


                 </p>
                 <hr />
                 <h2>types of files:</h2>
                 <p>1: master files; these are files of a permanent nature, and are updated regularly, to show a current position. For example, a payroll file, or inventory file. It is therefore seen that master records will contain both data of a standing nature, such as a customer name and address; and data that, by its nature will change each time a transaction occurs, for example, the balance figure of a customer’s “balance owing”, or “bill”.

<br />2: movement files or transaction files; this is a file containing records, that relate to individual transactions, that occur from day to day. The transaction records must all be processed. The sales day book entries are examples of transaction records, in transaction files, because all transaction records must be processed. Furthermore, transaction records that are input to a computer, at the same time are referred to as a transaction file of input records.

<br />3: reference file or index file; this is a file containing reference data, which is normally rarely updated. It contains no transaction data.  Examples of a reference files are often classified as a type of master file, because they both contain ‘standing’ reference data. More details on examples of reference files are, a price list, and names and addresses.

<br />4: Data files; a data file, is any type of computer file, that holds data.

<br />5: Program file; This is a file, which holds some item of software, such as a program.

<br />6: Text file; This is a file, that contains human readable text.

<br />7: Scratch file; This is a file no longer needed, which may be overwritten.

<br />8: Output file; This is a computer file, that contains data, that are the output of a device, or program.

<br />9: Input file; This is a computer file, that contains data, that serves as input to a device, or program.

<br />10: Work file; This is any file,, that you can work on.

<br />11: Document files; These are files that used to store documents such as letters, memos, etc.
</p>
                 <hr />
                 <h2></h2>
                 <p>
                     A key field is, an item of data, within the record, by which it can uniquely be identified.

<br />1: The key field in a transaction record is the item of data, which will be used to identify the master file record, with which it should be associated.
<br />2: They key field in a master record is the item of data by which the record in the file is arranged or indexed, for retrieval purposes.

<br />Note that the two storage devices for physical files are magnetic or optical disks and magnetic tapes.
</p>
<h2> file characteristics.</h2>
<p>1: Volatility. This is the frequency, with which, records are added, or deleted form a file. If the frequency is high, the file is said to be volatile. A file that is not altered, is said to be static.  If the frequency is low, the file is said to be semi-static.
<br />2: Size. This is the amount of data stored in a file.
<br />3: Growth. Files, often grow, steadily in size, as new records are added.
<br />4: Hit rate. Hit rate is a measure of the activity of the file. 
    </p>
                 <br />
                 <h2>how to protect files from corruption</h2>
                 <p>1: By backing up your data regularly. For example, C-D’s.
<br />2: By using virus detection software’s. For example, Microsoft essentials.
<br />3: By using security mechanisms, to control access to your files. For example, passwords.
<br />4: By verifying that the data you are adding to your files, is not corrupt, as this could corrupt all your files.
