    <h2>COMPUTER VIRUSES</h2>


                 <p>A   <strong> computer virus </strong>is a self-duplicating computer program that interferes with a computer’s hardware or operating system, the basic software that runs the computer. Viruses are designed to duplicate or replicate themselves and to avoid detection. Like any other computer program, a virus must be executed for it to function – that is, it must be located in the computer’s memory, and the computer must then follow the virus’s instructions. These instructions are called the payload of the virus. The payload may disrupt or change data files, display an irrelevant or unwanted message, or cause the operating system to malfunction.

                     </p>
                 <hr />
                 <h2>Types of Viruses</h2>
                <p> There are five categories of viruses: parasitic or file viruses, bootstrap sector, multi-partite, macro, and script viruses.
                 </p>

1. <h2>	Parasitic or File Viruses </h2>

<p>These viruses infect executable files or programs in the computer. These files attacked are often identified by the extension .exe in the name of the computer file. File viruses leave the contents of the host program unchanged but attach to the host in such a way that the virus code is run first. These viruses can be either direct-action or resident. A direct-action virus selects one or more programs to infect each time it is executed. A resident virus hides in the computer’s memory and infects a particular program when that program is executed.
    </p>

2.<h2>	Bootstrap Sector Viruses</h2>
    
 <p>These viruses reside on the first portion of the hard disk or floppy disk, known as the boot sector. These viruses replace either the programs that store information about the disk’s contents or the programs that start the computer. Typically, these viruses spread by means of the physical exchange of floppy disks.
</p>
3. <h2>	Multi-partite Viruses</h2>

   <p> These viruses combine the abilities of the parasitic and the bootstrap sector viruses, and so are able to infect either files or boot sectors. These types of viruses can spread if a computer user boots from an infected diskette or accesses infected files.
       </p>
4.	<h2> Macro Viruses
    </h2>

 <p> These are viruses that infect programs that contain powerful macro languages (programming languages that let the user create new features and utilities). These viruses are written in macro languages and automatically execute when the legitimate program is opened.
     </p>
5.<h2>	Script Viruses </h2>

 <p> These viruses are written in script programming languages, such as VBScript (Visual Basic Script) and JavaScript. These script languages can be seen as a special kind of macro language and are even more powerful because most are closely related to the operating system environment. The “ILOVEYOU” virus, which appeared in 2000 and infected an estimated 1 in 5 personal computers, is a famous example of a script virus.
     </p>

  <h2>  ANTI-VIRAL TACTICS</h2>

      <p>  <strong>  Preparation and Prevention</strong></p>

<p> Computer users can prepare for a viral infection by creating backups of legitimate original software and data files regularly so that the computer system can be restored if necessary. 
Viral infection can be prevented by obtaining software from legitimate sources or by using a quarantined computer to test new software – that is, a computer not connected to any network. However, the best prevention may be the installation of current and well-designed antiviral software. Such software can prevent a viral infection and thereby help stop its spread.
    </p>
        <h2>Virus Detection</h2>

<p>  Several types of antiviral software can be used to detect the presence of a virus. Scanning software can recognise the characteristics of a virus’s computer code and look for these characteristics in the computer’s files. Because new viruses must be analysed as they appear, scanning software must be updated periodically to be effective. Other scanners search for common features of viral programs and are usually less reliable. Most antiviral software use both on-demand and on-access scanners. On-demand scanners are launched only when the user activates them. On-access scanners, on the other hand, are constantly monitoring the computer for viruses but are always in the background and are not visible to the user. The on-access

               <h2>  VIRUSLIKE COMPUTER PROGRAMS</h2>

 <p >There are other harmful computer programs that can be part of a virus but are not considered viruses because they do not have the ability to replicate. These programs fall into three categories: Trojan horses, logic bombs, and deliberately harmful or malicious software programs that run within Web browsers, an application program such as Internet Explorer and Netscape that displays Web sites.
</p>

  <h2> Trojan Horse</h2>

<p> A   <strong> Trojan horse</strong> is a program that pretends to be something else. A Trojan horse may appear to be something interesting and harmless, such as a game, but when it runs it may have harmful effects. The term comes from the classic Greek story of the Trojan horse found in Homer’s Iliad. 
    </p>
 <h2> Logic Bomb</h2>

  <P>A <strong> logic bomb</strong> infects a computer’s memory, but unlike a virus, it does not replicate itself. A logic bomb delivers its instructions when it is triggered by a specific condition, such as when a particular date or time is reached or when a combination of letters is typed on a keyboard. A logic bomb has the ability to erase a hard drive or delete certain files.
</p>
    <h2> Malicious Software Programs</h2>

   <p>  These are programs that run within a Web browser often appearing in Java applets and ActiveX controls. Although these applets and controls improve the usefulness of Web sites, they also increase a vandal’s ability to interfere with unprotected systems. Because those controls and applets require that certain components be downloaded to a user’s personal computer (PC), activating an applet or control might actually download a malicious code.
