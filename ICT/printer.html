       <h2>PRINTERS</h2>

             <p>    A  <strong> printer </strong>is a device that records computer output on paper. Printers differ in a number of important respects. One involves the technology through which they output images. Another is size; you can hold some computer printers in your 
                 </p>

               <h2 > There are two main classifications of printers</h2>


              <p>   <strong >•	Impact</strong></p>

<p>In <strong></strong>, the print head mechansim strikes an inked ribbon located between the print head and the paper. The general features of impact printers are 
</p>

<p>  <br />•	uses force by applying hammer pins to strike the paper 

<br />•	slow speed in characters per second 
<br />•	prints on most paper types 
<br />•	transperancies not supported 
<br />•	multiple copies may be printed at once
     </p>
  <p> <strong>  The two main types of impact printers are Dot-Matrix and Daisy-Wheel.</strong> </p>
                 <hr />
 <p>  <br /><strong> •	Non-Impact</strong></p>
<p>With non-impact printers, the print head does not make contact with the paper, and no inked ribbon is necessary. The general features of non-impact printers are 
</p>

<p><br />•	print head does not make contact with the paper 
<br />•	higher speed in characters per second is possible 
<br />•	prints on most paper types but better quality obtained with better paper 
<br />•	transperancies usually supported 
    </p>
<p>The three main types of non-impact printers are laserjet, ink-jet and thermal. </p>


                 <hr />

              <p> <strong>  PRINTERS </strong> – are classified as
<br />a. <strong>	Character printers</strong> – which prints one character at a time. The most common example is dot matrix, daisy wheel etc. Usually cheaper, slow and noisy.
<br />b.<strong>	Line printer </strong>– print whole line at a time. Examples are drum printers, chain and band printers.
<br />c.<strong>	Page printers </strong> – also called image printers which prints whole page at a time. Common examples are the laser printer usually fast quiet and high quality hard copy.

                 </p>
                 <hr />
                 <h2>Another classification is by speed.</h2>
                 <p>
                     1.	<strong> Low speed includes</strong> – character printers
<br />2. <strong>	High speed printer</strong> – line and page printers

                 </p>
                 <hr />
                 <h2>Character /low speed printers.</h2>



                   <p>
                 <strong> Dot matrix </strong>also referred to as character printers. They were once the most popularly used low speed printers. They remain popular for general use where print quality is not very critical. They are often used in conjunction with computerized tills.
             </p>
             <p>
<strong>  Features.</strong>
<br />-	It prints character by character.
<br />-	Mimics the action of the typewriter by printing a character at a time.
<br />-	The character matrix may be 7*5,7*7,9*7 etc.
<br />-	Lines typically 80 — 160 characters per cross
<br />-	Speed is typically 55 cps
<br />-	Using carbon paper may produce   
<br />-	 multiple print copies. </p> 
                 <hr />
<h2> Daisy wheel</h2>
  <p><br />-	Less popular
<br />-	An impact shaped character printer fitted with
exchangeable print leads called daisy wheels.
<br />-	To print each character wheel is rotated and appropriate spoke is stuck against ribbon.
<br />-	Typically speed 45 cps
<br />-     Similar to Dot matrix printers in terms of  page size and multiple job printing.</p>
                 <hr />
 <h2> Inkjet printer</h2>
<p> Act as a character printer. The newly made inkjet are able to print a page.
<br />-	These are non-impact page printers often having in built scalable. Fonts.
<br />-	They operate by firing very tiny ink droplets on paper by using an electrostatic field.
<br />-	They are quieter and higher speed than the daisy and dot matrix printers - Some are able to print color images.
    </p>
                 <hr />
 <h2> Line printers </h2>
                 <p>— so called because they print one line at a time rather than one character at a time. They are both considerably faster and more expensive than character.
Usually useful to the mainframe computers where large volume of data is printed out.</p>


                 <hr />
                 <h2>Types of line printers </h2>
            

                 
                     
                              <h2 >Chain printer</h2>
<p>impact printer which employee's flexible loops.
<br />-	It has a chain with embossed (marked) mirror image characters driven around at a constants speed.
<br />-	Has as set of electromagnetic hammers provided, and each hammer is individually activated when the required character is in front of the paper.
</p>
	<h2> Band printer</h2>
 <p>The principle of operation is faster model. It has the character engraved on steel metal, which moves at a constant high speed when printing. It has a magnetically controlled hammer that forces the paper against the appropriate print slug.
</p>
	<h2> The Drum </h2>

    <p>	— it is also called barrel printer.
<br />-	It has continuously revolving metal drum containing complete sets of mirror image of characters around its surface.
<br />-	A line of characters is printed by the action of a set of hammers across the paper.</p>

   <h2 >Advantages of a line printer</h2>
                                                       <p> 1.    prints at high speed.
<br />2.	It can be used to print large volume of data that's why it is mostly connected to mainframe
 computers.

<br />3.	Prints lines by lines better than a character printer.

</p>

    <h2>Disadvantages.</h2>
<p>1.  More expensive than character printers
<br />2. Make some noise as compared to page  
    printer.</p>

                 <h2>PAGE PRINTERS</h2>
<p> <strong> PAGE PRINTERS (Image printer)</strong> — they print the whole page at a time.
  <strong> Features. </strong>
<br />-	Complete page is assembled at a time as opposed to one character printer or line printer.
 Have much higher printing speed
<br />-	Non impact printer
<br />-	Ability to make one page at a time.
<br />-	Ability to provide outputs in graphics,   
<br />-	texts or combination.
    .
    <strong> Common example is a laser printer</strong> 
                 </p>

                 
                 
                    <h2> Advantages of page printers</h2>
<p><br />-	It is faster than character printer and          line printers. - Noise free
<br />.-	Has high quality fonts
<br />-	It is cleaner than character and line printer</p>


    
       <h2>  DISADVANTAGES</h2>
<p>-	It is more expensive to buy than character printers It only allows one page to be printed at a time as not with the character printer, which can print, multiple copies at time by use the carbon papers.

    </.p>
                 <hr />
                 <h2>Factors affecting the selecting of the printer. </h2>
                 <p>
 <br /><strong> Appropriateness</strong> – is the printer appropriate for your operations in your Organization. If you print large volume of data every day a high speed printer is better. In quiet working environment a non-impact printer would be possible.

 <br /><strong>  Cost     </strong>   -     High speed and extra printers, mean high     
                      purchase price.

<br /><strong> Accuracy </strong>-  Printer accuracy in positioning characters varies   
                     greatly. Impact line printers often produce slightly 
                     faint characters and uneven clear lines whereas  
                     inkjet and laser printers produce clear and
                             accurate prints.

<br /><strong> Volume</strong>      -	the amount of data to be printed depends on the printer's speed. Obviously high-speed printers are favored in this case.

<br /> <strong>  Confidence</strong> – well-proven printer types such as line printer tend to be favored.
                                         
                 </p>
                 <hr />
                 <h2> Summary</h2>
<p>The two main classifications of printers are impact and non-impact.<br /> In impact printers, the print head makes physical contact, using force to create the characters. <br />
<br />Examples of impact printers are dot-matrix and daisy wheel printers. As new technology is developed, these mechanical type printers are becoming increasingly outdated. 
<br />Examples of non-impact printers are laserjet and inkjet. These printers offer superior quality and greater options (in terms of the number of fonts and quality of graphic pictures).
